## Installation Instructions

### For Developers

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fullerton-deal-depot.git` 

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    `cd fullerton-deal-depot` 
    
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    
    `npm install` 
    
4.  Set up environment variables:

    -   **Create a `.env` file in the project root**: Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) or manually create it. Add the necessary configuration, such as your database URL and other keys.
    
    - **Important**: **Do not include sensitive information in the repository.** Add your own values for the environment variables in your local `.env` file. Here's an example structure for your `.env` file:

    ```plaintext
    POSTGRES_URL=your_database_url_here
    ```

5. Run the backend locally:
    
    ```
    nodemon src/app.js 
    ```


This will start the development server with hot-reloading enabled, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Known Issues

-   Images are stored locally in development, but may not persist when deployed on platforms like Vercel.
-   Limited testing coverage for edge cases.
-   Scalability issues may arise as the product list grows, due to current image storage methods.

## To-do Items

-   Add authentication and authorization for secure API access.
-   Write additional unit tests for product and order processing functionality.
-   Optimize product search and filtering features.
-   Improve error handling for database transactions.
-   Set up new routes for the new tables (Products, Orders, Users, etc.).
